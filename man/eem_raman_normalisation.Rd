\title{Fluorescence Intensity Calibration Using the Raman Scatter Peak of Water}
\usage{
eem_raman_normalisation(eem, blank = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{eem}{An object of class \code{eemlist}.}

\item{blank}{An object of class \code{eemlist}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{eemlist}.

An object of class \code{eem} containing: \itemize{ \item sample The
  file name of the eem. \item x A matrix with fluorescence values. \item em
  Emission vector of wavelengths. \item ex Excitation vector of wavelengths.
  }
}
\description{
Normalize fluorescence intensities to the standard scale of
  Raman Units (R.U).
}
\details{
The function will first try to use the provided \code{blank}. If the
  blank is omitted, the function will then try to extract the blank from the
  \code{eemlist} object. This is done by looking for sample names containing
  one of these complete or partial strings (ignoring case):

  \enumerate{ \item nano \item miliq \item milliq \item mq \item blank }

  Note that if \code{blank} is omitted, the function will group the
  \code{eemlist} based on file location and will assumes that there is a
  blank sample in each folder. In that context, the blank will be used on
  each sample in the same folder. If more than one blank is found they will
  be averaged (a message will be printed if this appends).

  Consider the following example where there are two folders that could
  represent scans performed on two different days `scans_day_1` and
  `scans_day_2`.

  \tabular{ll}{ scans_day_1\tab\cr \tab nano.csv\cr \tab sample1.csv\cr \tab
  sample2.csv\cr \tab sample3.csv\cr scans_day_2 \tab\cr \tab blank.csv\cr
  \tab s1.csv\cr \tab s2.csv\cr \tab s3.csv\cr }

  In each folder there are three samples and one blank files. In that
  context, `eem_remove_blank()` will use the blank `nano.csv` from
  `sample1.csv`, `sample2.csv` and `sample3.csv`. The same strategy will be
  used for files in folder `scans_day_2` but with blank named `blank.csv`.

  Note that the blanks eem are not returned by the function.

The normalization procedure consists in dividing all fluorescence
  intensities by the area (integral) of the Raman peak. The peak is located
  at excitation of 350 nm. (ex = 370) between 371 nm. and 428 nm in emission
  (371 <= em <= 428). Note that the data is interpolated to make sure that
  fluorescence at em 350 exist.

\examples{
# Open the fluorescence eem
file <- system.file("extdata/cary/scans_day_1", "sample1.csv", package = "eemR")
eem <- eem_read(file, import_function = "cary")

plot(eem)

# Open the blank eem
file <- system.file("extdata/cary/scans_day_1", "nano.csv", package = "eemR")
blank <- eem_read(file, import_function = "cary")

# Do the normalisation
eem <- eem_raman_normalisation(eem, blank)

plot(eem)
