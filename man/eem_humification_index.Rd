\title{Calculate the fluorescence humification index (HIX)}
\usage{
eem_humification_index(eem, scale = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eem}{An object of class \code{eemlist}.}

\item{scale}{Logical indicating if HIX should be scaled, default is FALSE.
See details for more information.}

\item{verbose}{Logical determining if additional messages should be printed.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{eemlist}.

A data frame containing the humification index (HIX) for each eem.
}
\description{
The fluorescence humification index (HIX), which compares two
  broad aromatic dominated fluorescence maxima, is calculated at 254 nm
  excitation by dividing the sum of fluorescence intensities between emission
  435 to 480 nm by the the sum of fluorescence intensities between 300 to 345
  nm.
}
\section{Interpolation}{


  Different excitation and emission wavelengths are often used to measure
  EEMs. Hence, it is possible to have mismatchs between measured wavelengths
  and wavelengths used to calculate specific metrics. In these
  circumstances, EEMs are interpolated using the
  \code{\link[pracma]{interp2}} function from the \code{parcma} library. A
  message warning the user will be prompted if data interpolation is
  performed.
