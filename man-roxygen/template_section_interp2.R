#' @section Interpolation:
#'
#'   Different excitation and emission wavelengths are often used to measure
#'   EEMs. Hence, it is possible to have mismatchs between measured wavelengths
#'   and wavelengths used to calculate specific metrics. In these
#'   circumstances, EEMs are interpolated using the
#'   \code{\link[pracma]{interp2}} function from the \code{parcma} library. A
#'   message warning the user will be prompted if data interpolation is
#'   performed.
